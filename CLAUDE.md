`@entur/mui-comps-nmr` — small React MUI component lib for Entur's
[hathor](https://github.com/entur/hathor) frontend. Types come from live
[sobek](https://github.com/entur/sobek) GraphQL schema. Previewed w/ Storybook.
Status: seed, unpublished. Storybook deploys to GitHub Pages.

## Core

Two layers. **Presentational**: `createAbstractEntityDetailsForm<E>(fields)` →
typed React form. No data fetch, no save, no i18n runtime, no router.
**Data-aware**: generated wrappers `VehicleForm` / `VehicleTypeForm` (from
`scripts/generateWrappers.ts`, one per `entities.manifest.json` entry) wrap it
and do load/save over sobek GraphQL via the internal `useEntityForm` hook.
Public API in `src/index.ts`. `src/EntityDetailsForm/formImpls/*` is generator
output — **never hand-edit**; fix the template in `generateWrappers.ts` and
re-run it.

**Layout of `src/EntityDetailsForm/`** — root holds the contract only
(`index.ts`, `types.ts`); `components/` everything that renders (`abstractForm`,
`controls`, `EditFooter`, `SaveSnackbar`), `hooks/` the one hook, `utils/` the
pure functions (`paths`, `toInput`, `reduceToSobekInput`, `normalizeErrors`,
`dirty`), `formImpls/` the generated wrappers. Tests sit beside their subject.
Two files outside the directory hardcode paths into it and must move with it:
`scripts/distillTypes.ts` (`TYPES_IMPORT`, why `types.ts` stays at the root —
moving it rewrites every committed `src/entities/*`) and
`scripts/generateWrappers.ts`, whose emitted imports name
`../components/{abstractForm,EditFooter}` and are pinned by
`generateWrappers.test.ts`.

`SobekProvider` (`src/context/SobekContext.tsx`) is a typed FC, not the raw
`Context.Provider`: `value: SobekCtx` is required, so a host threading a
possibly-undefined session is a compile error rather than a render-time throw
from inside a consumer. It memoizes per field, so an inline object literal
doesn't re-render every consumer.

**Async state is React 19's, not hand-rolled.** The load is a promise read
with `use()` behind a `<Suspense>`; the save is an Action (`useTransition`), so
`saving` is the transition's own pending flag. Between them they retired the
reducer, the `epoch` counter checked at 10 sites, the `mounted` ref, and the
shared `GraphQLClient` that was re-`setHeaders`-ed before every request (one
client per request now, so a token refresh mid-flight can't re-header a request
already out). Staleness is decided by **identity**: every load is tagged with
the key that asked for it (`endpoint|dataOwnerRef|netexId`), and a superseded
load resolves into a render nobody performs.

Two hooks, and the split is load-bearing: **`useEntityResource(config, netexId)`
must be called above the boundary** — a component that suspends on its *first*
render is discarded whole, hooks included, so a ref inside the suspending
component cannot hold the promise `use()` needs to see again on the retry. The
component rendering `<Suspense>` never suspends, so its ref can. `useEntityForm`
takes the resource as a prop.

`useEntityForm` contract (not exported; `src/EntityDetailsForm/hooks/`):
session inputs come from the **mandatory `SobekProvider`** (`endpoint`,
`headers`, `getHeaders`, `dataOwnerRef`) — wrappers no longer take them as
props, and the hook throws when no provider is above. Headers resolved **per
request** (dynamic wins over static), and no session input is ref-guarded any
more: nothing runs off an effect's dependency list, so inline literals can't
re-fire anything. `dataOwnerRef` is in the key, so an org switch re-loads and a
row fetched under one org can never land in a form showing another. It is also
stamped onto the mutation input from context at the wire edge (never from form
state) and filters both the load and the post-save refetch — but only when the
entity's `FIELDS` actually carries `dataOwnerRef` as `locked` (registry-driven,
not by key name: an Input without it must not get one). `netexId` set →
`undefined` keeps `value` and abandons the in-flight load; it does not blank the
form. Load settled-ness is a `load` phase (`idle|ok|error`) — there is **no
`pending`, and no `loading` flag at all**: a pending record has not committed,
so the branch that used to flash `Not found` on the first commit no longer
exists. `load === 'ok'` + no value renders `Not found: <netexId>`;
`load === 'error'` renders `errors.__init`, so a failed load is never reported
as a missing record. **Both halves fail alike**: load and save each normalize
the thrown error, hand the server's own messages to `onError`, and fall back to
a constant (`'Failed to load'` / `'Failed to save'`) only when the payload
carries no GraphQL `errors` array. Load messages also land in `errors.__init`,
joined by `'; '` (`onError` gets them unjoined). The load path normalizes
against an **empty** registry — a query takes a netexId, not an `input`, so
every message is general by construction and none can be lost to field routing.

A failed load is a **settled value, not a rejected promise**
(`{ ok: false, messages }`): `use()` would rethrow a rejection into the nearest
error boundary, unmounting the form and taking the edits with it. So failure is
data, and a failed *re*load still sits beside an editable entity — `held` (a
ref) keeps the last entity the server actually handed back, which is also what
survives a switch into create mode. `onError` fires from an effect keyed on the
settled result, so it fires once per record and never for a load the form has
moved on from.

**Host observation** (`onChange` / `onDirtyChange`, both optional, both
ref-held so an inline arrow can't re-fire the effects). `onChange` fires on
*every* value change — load and post-save refetch included, not just edits — so
a host header can show the loaded name without waiting for a keystroke.
Observation only: the hook keeps owning the value, and feeding it back in as a
prop is unsupported (it would reintroduce the load races). Dirty is computed
against a `baseline` that is *derived*, not stored: the settled load, or what a
save moved forward (tagged with the key it belongs to, which is how a stale
save is ignored). The tag alone isn't the guard, though: the save's whole
completion — `held`, the draft reset, the error reset — is gated on a live-key
ref, because the one switch that *doesn't* suspend (edit → create) commits
while the Action is still out. Only `onSaved` fires regardless: the mutation
committed server-side, wherever the form went. That baseline is also dropped on
every key change (create mode included), or it would outrank the refetch when a
record is revisited and show what this session saved instead of what the server
now holds. `value = draft ?? baseline`, so
an untouched form **is** its baseline and a load or a save leaves it clean with
nothing to re-baseline. The draft is discarded when the record changes, so a new
record can't be masked by the previous one's edits. The comparison (`src/EntityDetailsForm/utils/dirty.ts`) treats `undefined | null | false |
'' | []` as one value, which is what stops an untouched Switch reporting `false`
against a null-backed baseline, or a text field typed into and cleared, from
reading as edits. `0` is deliberately not empty. Both callbacks reach the hook
through the generated wrapper's `...rest`, so the generator only declares them
on `<Entity>FormProps` — nothing else in the template changes.

**Loading.** While a record is in flight the wrapper's `<Suspense>` shows
`FormSkeleton` (`src/EntityDetailsForm/components/FormSkeleton.tsx`) as its
fallback, not a text placeholder — this is the whole of the loading branch now,
which is why the wrapper splits into `<Entity>Form` (boundary + resource) and
`<Entity>FormRecord` (the suspending half).
Its shape is **derived, never tuned**: `resolveSections`
(`src/EntityDetailsForm/utils/sections.ts` — extracted from `abstractForm` so
both call it) yields the same sections/fields the form will draw, and each
placeholder is sized from the field's `kind` (`KIND_H`). A new entity or an
edited `layout`/`variant` reshapes both at once, so there is no row-count
literal to drift (hathor's `VEHICLE_FORM_ROWS = 7` is the anti-pattern). The
arriving form fades in via `FormArrival`, which wraps the **presentation only**
— its keyframe animates `transform`, and a transformed ancestor becomes a
containing block, which would break `EditFooter`'s `position: sticky` for the
length of the fade. Both honour `prefers-reduced-motion` (the guard also kills
MUI's `wave`, which ships none). Host reach is `skeletonProps`
(`FormSkeletonHostProps` = `ariaLabel` + `sx`); the shape is deliberately not
overridable. `Not found` and the load-error branch stay plain text — a skeleton
means "content is coming", which misreads on a terminal state.

**Edit session.** In `mode='edit'` the wrapper renders `EditFooter`
(`src/EntityDetailsForm/components/EditFooter.tsx`) rather than a bare Save button: a
status line plus Cancel/Save, all three **inert until `dirty`** — so Save can't
re-send an unchanged entity and Cancel can't discard nothing. Both actions also
lock while `saving` (a discard mid-flight would restore a baseline the in-flight
request is about to replace). Cancel is the hook's `reset()` — drop the draft and
the save errors, with no request. It keeps `errors.__init` for free: that one is
*derived* from the load rather than stored, so a discard cannot drop it, and
consumers rendering the `'error'` phase always have a message. That replaces the host-side remount-under-a-new-`key` idiom, which
threw away the loaded entity and re-fetched it; the `key` remount is still the
way to switch *records*. The band is **sticky, so its own `backgroundColor`
stays opaque** (`background.paper`) and the dirty tint rides on top as a flat
`linear-gradient` — an `alpha()` colour there is 92% see-through and the fields
scroll visibly through the buttons. Host reach: `footerProps`
(`EditFooterHostProps` = `EditFooterProps` minus the state the hook owns) carries
`labels` (English defaults, no i18n runtime here), `slotProps` (per-button MUI
overrides, applied *before* the controlled `disabled`/`onClick`) and `sx`
(applied after every default, so `backgroundImage: 'none'` drops the tint).
`EditFooter` and `SaveSnackbar` are exported presentational components holding
no state, so a host driving the presentational form directly (or rendering its
own chrome from `onSaved`/`onError`) uses the same pieces.

- `mode` `'view' | 'edit'` — view disables inputs.
- `layout?` — whitelist of sections (`{ Section: [fields] }`). Omitted field not
  rendered but value round-trips via `onChange` (loss-free). Omit layout → flat.
- `variant?` `'tabs' | 'stacked'` — for ≥2 sections. Default `tabs`.
- `labelPlacement?` `'float' | 'start'` — default `float` (MUI's label inside the
  control, original markup byte-for-byte). `start` emits label + control as
  sibling grid items (`FieldRow`), label column `max-content`, collapsing below
  480px of the form's own inline size (`@container`, not viewport). The label
  moves out of the control, so each kind is re-bound by hand: `htmlFor` →
  `controlId` for everything with a real input, **`aria-labelledby` for `enum`**
  — a `TextField select` is a non-labelable `div[role=combobox]`, so `FieldRow`
  gets a `labelId` and `renderControl` feeds it back via
  `slotProps.select.labelId`. `grid` keeps `ObjectGrid`'s own `aria-label`.
  `FormSkeleton` mirrors the geometry from the same constants.
- `serverManaged` fields (`version`, `created`, `changed`, `changedBy`) hidden
  from editable model: locked even in edit, surfaced only to *see* meta/semantic
  context. Backend-owned — **not round-tripped**, never in write payload, don't
  travel back as edits. (vs ordinary omitted field, whose value *does* pass
  through `onChange`.) Stale after save — client refetches.
- `locked` fields (`dataOwnerRef`) — client-supplied but not user-editable:
  rendered and always disabled even in edit, **never sourced from form state**
  into the write payload (the host supplies the value at the wire edge — the
  hook stamps `dataOwnerRef` from context, so it *is* sent, just never from
  the edited entity). Errors on them route to `generalErrors`. Distinct from
  `serverManaged`: that means backend-owned and is *derived* by distill from
  the Entity/Input diff; `locked` is assigned explicitly via distill's
  `LOCKED_FIELDS` set (carried through the `reference` fast-path too, so a
  locked write-as-reference relation stays locked). The wrapper overlays the
  context value for display on **every** render
  (`{ ...(value ?? {}), dataOwnerRef }`), not just while `value` is undefined
  — otherwise the control keeps showing the org current at first keystroke
  while the save stamps the new one.
- Labels default to humanized key. Override per-field `{ field, label }`. No i18n
  dep — localization is client's job.
- `grid` fields render array-of-obj relations as a read-only table; cols
  auto-derived from row data. Layout entry `entries` (`{ field, label }[]`, `field`
  = row-obj key) fixes col order + labels. Grid omits its own caption when alone
  in a section (tab/heading names it), shows it when beside other fields.
- `reference` fields edit a single relation by its identity leaf. With a layout
  entry `options` (`() => { value, label }[]`, value = referenced netexId) →
  single-select Autocomplete; omit (incl. zero-config) → free-text id field.
  Selection writes the `netexId` leaf; round-trips as the full relation object.
- `date` / `datetime` render native `<input type=date|datetime-local>` (no date
  dep). `datetime` value is the stored ISO sliced to `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm`.
- `slotProps?` (form-level) — per-`kind` MUI overrides. TextField-backed kinds
  (`text|number|name|enum|date|datetime`) take TextField `slotProps` (merged over
  the label-shrink default); `enumMulti`→Autocomplete, `switch`→`SwitchProps`,
  `grid`→`{ dataGrid }`. Per-field override is a planned later addition.

## GraphQL → TS pipeline

Never hand-maintain entity shapes. Generate from live schema, distill to
per-entity modules.

- Schema URL: `https://entur.github.io/sobek/schema.graphqls`
- `npm run codegen` — download schema (`scripts/fetchSchema.ts`) → emit
  `src/generated/sobekTypes.ts` (types + runtime enums). Git-ignored artifact.
- `npm run distill` (chains codegen) — parse generated types → write **committed**
  `src/entities/*`. Each: `Entity` type (verbatim, nested), `FIELDS` registry
  (flat addressable map; value-object leaves hoisted w/ `path`; carries `kind`,
  `path`, `options`, `serverManaged`, `locked`).
  `kind` ∈ `text|number|name|switch|enum|enumMulti|grid|reference|date|datetime`.
  `serverManaged` **derived** = on `Entity`, not on `Input` (no client tag).
  `locked` **assigned** = member of distill's `LOCKED_FIELDS` set
  (`dataOwnerRef`) and not serverManaged (serverManaged wins on overlap).
  Array-of-identity-objects (e.g. `vehicles`) → one `grid` field (read-only
  table, `ObjectGrid`/MUI X Data Grid; always serverManaged). **Read-object /
  write-reference divergence**: a single relation whose same-named `Input` member
  is a *pure reference* (members ⊆ `{id, netexId}`, e.g. `transportType`/`deckPlan`
  via `*ReferenceInput`) → one `reference` field on the identity leaf (writable,
  not serverManaged; the fast-path `continue`s before `deriveFields`, so it must
  apply `locked` itself). Other single relations + id-less object arrays (e.g.
  `keyValues`) get no `FIELDS` entry but stay on `Entity`. Edits write one leaf by
  `path`, never whole object — so scalar edit can't drop a relation, and edited
  `value` round-trips as complete entity. `src/entities/index.ts` re-exports per
  entity name.

### Patch overlay

`schema/sobek.patch.graphqls` — committed SDL overlay applied before codegen,
for fields the live schema hasn't shipped. Currently `manufacturer`, `range`,
`fullCharge`, `carLoading` on VehicleType. Extends **both** `type VehicleType`
and `input VehicleTypeInput`: the read half satisfies distill's "Input ⊆ Entity"
check, the input half keeps the field out of `serverManaged` (derived = on
`Entity`, not on `Input`) — read-only extend ⇒ permanently locked control. When
sobek ships a field for real, delete matching `extend` lines by hand (done for
`dataOwnerRef`, now a real read field).

**Invariant: the patch is an input to `codegen.ts` only.** Wire-facing
generators (`scripts/generateDocuments.ts`, `codegen-operations.ts`) read
`sobek.schema.graphqls` alone, so a patched field is absent from every selection
set by construction — no prune list to drift. Dropping the patch from
`codegen-operations.ts` also makes it *validate* documents against the live
schema, so a leak fails codegen instead of the backend (nothing else catches it:
`src/stories/mockEndpoint.ts` is a schema-free `fetch` interceptor).

The write half can't be fixed by a document — `$input` is a runtime variable —
so `generateDocuments` emits `src/generated/operations/inputKeys.ts`, one
`<Entity>InputKeys` mask per manifest entity read from the live schema's
`<Entity>Input`. `useEntityForm` applies it via `reduceToSobekInput(inp, mask)`
right after `toInputEntity`, before the `dataOwnerRef` stamp (a wire field, so
unaffected). The `satisfies Record<keyof <Entity>Input, 1>` on each mask is a
real guard, not decoration: keys come from `generateDocuments`' schema read, the
type from graphql-codegen's — feed the patch to either and the build fails.
`distillTypes.ts` and `toInput.ts` are deliberately untouched, so patched fields
stay editable and round-trip through `onChange`; only the wire edge strips them.
Residue: `Types.<Entity>Input` in `sobekTypes.ts` stays patched, so the
*variables type* still permits those keys at compile time — only the runtime
mask stops them.

## Tests

Vitest + Testing Library, jsdom. `npm run test` — `pretest` runs `generate`
(→ `distill` → `codegen`), so the suite always runs against freshly generated
wrappers and entities. Corollary: a hand-edit under `formImpls/` is silently
wiped by `npm test`.

**Never write a test per generated entity.** Anything covering generator output
is driven by `entities.manifest.json`, so a new entity is covered the moment it
is generated: `formImpls/wrappers.test.tsx` does `describe.each` over the
manifest and resolves each component from the generated `formImpls/index.ts`
barrel (`${Entity}Form`) and its registry from the `entities` barrel
(`${camel}Fields`). Everything entity-shaped is derived — `queryRoot` builds the
mock response, locked fields come from `FIELDS`, labels from `humanize(key)`. No
entity literals in the assertions. It throws when a manifest entry has no
exported wrapper or no registry, so a broken generator run fails loudly rather
than silently skipping. (`vehicleForm.test.tsx` was the anti-pattern: VehicleType
shipped untested because nobody wrote the sibling file.)

Three techniques worth keeping:

- **Anything that suspends must be rendered inside an *awaited* `act`.** A
  render that suspends parks its retry on the act queue, and the synchronous
  `act` inside RTL's bare `render`/`renderHook` has already exited by then — the
  tree sits on its fallback forever and every `waitFor` times out with no
  explanation. `await act(async () => { render(…) })`, then `waitFor` as usual.
  Both suites wrap this as `mount()`/`swap()`. React also throttles a
  fallback→content reveal by ~300 ms, so the reveal lands after the act exits,
  not inside it.
- **First-commit assertions need `flushSync` on a bare `createRoot`**, not RTL's
  `render` — `render` wraps in `act()`, which flushes passive effects before it
  returns and hides anything that only exists on the first commit (this is what
  masked the `Not found` flash). `flushSync` commits synchronously and leaves
  passive effects scheduled.
- **A regression test must be seen failing against the pre-fix code.** The
  original `Not found` test passed vacuously — its `waitFor` was satisfied by the
  flash it was meant to forbid. Revert the fix, watch it fail, restore.

`scripts/*.test.ts` test the generator/distiller as string transforms (assert on
emitted source), so template changes are pinned without running codegen.

## Build

`npm run build` — Vite library mode → `dist/`. Emits ESM (`index.js`), CJS
(`index.cjs`), types (`index.d.ts` via `vite-plugin-dts`). React/MUI/Emotion +
`graphql-request` are externalized peer deps — host owns single copy (avoids
"two Reacts"). React 19, MUI 7, Emotion 11 pinned to match hathor.
`graphql` is never imported directly (only through `graphql-request`), so
externalizing the client keeps the graphql runtime out of `dist` too — no
`dependencies` block at all now.
