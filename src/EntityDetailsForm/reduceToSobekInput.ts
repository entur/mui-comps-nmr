/**
 * Reduce a form-derived input object to the fields the live sobek schema accepts.
 *
 * `FIELDS` is distilled from the *patched* schema, so `toInputEntity` can hand
 * back keys (`manufacturer`, `range`, …) that exist only in
 * `schema/sobek.patch.graphqls`. The backend rejects those, so they are stripped
 * here — at the wire edge, leaving the form model itself untouched.
 *
 * @param inp  full input built by `toInputEntity` (may carry patch-only fields)
 * @param mask generated wire-key set for the entity's `<Entity>Input`
 * @returns a shallow copy holding only the keys `mask` declares
